Clone repo, npm install then npm start.

Update: Tests added using react testing library 17/09. use "npm run test" or "npm run test-coverage".

The test looked like it didn't require typescript or testing (I would have used react testing library). I managed to complete with 3 mins to spare after switching from Codility 15/09.
